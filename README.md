The code contains 2 models for Gas Lift Oil Wells, a more complex and a simpler one that can be used for model mismatch studies. 
Most literature use OLGA simulator or linearized models for model mismatch studies, this paper introduces an example of 
Gas Lift Oil wells models of different complexities that can be used for such studies.
